# Contributing to Sauron

First of all, thanks for taking time to contribute!

The following text would describe how to contribute to Sauron. I would keep this document in short, to help everyone finish it.

### Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Sauron Code of Conduct](https://github.com/racket-tw/sauron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to dannypsnl@gmail.com.

### Code Standard

I actually didn't care about code standard, but contributor can follow [Racket Style Guide](https://docs.racket-lang.org/style/index.html) if you want.
Let's see if need more specific standard in the future.

NOTE: Prefer comment rather than **smart** code.

### PR Standard

Since this is a GUI project, automatically testing everything is impossible, I would believe people the functionality they made already tested.

In a PR, make sure you:

1. clearly explain purpose(which feature, any tricky hack need to record in document for contributors?)
2. correctly refer to related issue(if there has no issue, create one)
3. update document if PR
  1. related to key binding
  2. create a new window
  3. changing behavior
