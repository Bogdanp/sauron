@defmodule[sauron]

In sauron, all `cmd`/`ctrl` would be called `c`, `alt`/`option` called `o`.

@section{Shortcut}

@(itemlist
  ;;; file
  @item{c+o open file}
  @item{c+s save file(would auto indent code)}
  ;;; edit
  @item{c+a select all}
  @item{c+c copy}
  @item{c+v paste}
  @item{c+z undo}
  @item{c+x cut}
  ;;; move cursor
  @item{c+<up>/<down>/<left>/<right> move to most up/down/left/right}
  @item{o+<left> move left by a token/s-exp}
  @item{o+<right> move right by a token/s-exp}
  ; jump to definition
  @item{c+b or <click> jump to definition(notice that only identifier is clickable to trigger this)}
  ; refactor
  @item{c+r rename all bound}
  ;;; comment/uncomment
  @item{c+; comment selected text or line if uncommented, uncomment if commented}
  ;;; misc
  @item|{(/[/{/" when has selected text, wrap selected text automatically}|)

@section{Auto complete}

Warning: Only consider #lang racket currently, would try to support more variant in the future.

Sauron try to improve experience when programming Racket, one of the important features was auto completion, Sauron provides several builtin form.
Full list can refer to @code[#:lang "racket"]{racket-builtin-form*} in @(link "https://github.com/racket-tw/sauron/blob/master/meta.rkt" "meta.rkt").
When you introduce identifier, Sauron would record it to provide completion.

For example:

@(racketblock
  (define (id x) x))

Type @code[#:lang "racket"]{i} would trigger completion.

@section{LaTeX input}

Sauron also supports convert input \all to âˆ€. This is helpful for PLT or Math researchers. Full list can refer to @code[#:lang "racket"]{latex-complete} in @(link "https://github.com/racket-tw/sauron/blob/master/meta.rkt" "meta.rkt").

@section{Develop}

ctrl/command and alt/option just rely on this function from racket/gui @racketlink[gui:get-default-shortcut-prefix]{get-default-shortcut-prefix}.
